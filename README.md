# What can our project do?
So, the project description for the pygame project is MKGames. Our project combines various technologies,
such as Pygame, PyQt, sqlite. Our project uses the MsgPack file type -
3 times faster than json and 9 times faster than lists, which gives us a significant advantage
over optimization. In our project you can play 3 games - Snake (WarSnake), Flappy Bird and most importantly -
a platformer in two worlds (S2WAdventure). I think everyone understands about the snake and the jumping bird, but what about S2WAdventure.
S2WAdventure is a platformer without the ability to get up and wait. Some platforms are invisible to the character in the game.
But just press tab and the platforms that were invisible will become tangible, but those that existed will disappear. It
's quite interesting and fascinating. Also, for completing the levels of the game or games, you are given the currency of the game in the amount of 1 coin.
For this, you can buy a skin for a character or buy a game. When you enter the game, you have 1 coin and you can buy any one game.
Our slogan is Enter another world.
